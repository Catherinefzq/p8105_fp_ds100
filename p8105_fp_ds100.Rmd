## Proposal 
(Writing proposal here!!)
First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

The group members (names and UNIs)
The tentative project title: mortality

first_name: Junyuan
last_name_name: Zheng

The tentative project title
The motivation for this project
The intended final products
The anticipated data sources
The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
The planned timeline
There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using .Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. Conceptually, this is intended to review a project that is 10% complete.
