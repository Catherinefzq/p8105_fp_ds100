The group members (names and UNIs) The tentative project title: mortality The motivation for this project The intended final products The anticipated data sources The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges The planned timeline There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using .Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. Conceptually, this is intended to review a project that is 10% complete.
