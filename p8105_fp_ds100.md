#### The tentative project title

Title: **1999 - 2016 U.S. Self-Inflicted Suicide Mortality Analysis**

#### The motivation for this project

Motivation: Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US. Suicide rates increased in nearly every state from 1999 through 2016. Mental health conditions are often seen as the cause of suicide, but suicide is rarely caused by any single factor. In fact, many people who die by suicide are not known to have a diagnosed mental health condition at the time of death. We are interested in examining the variations of suicide death rates among different categorical variables such as gender, race, age group, and to test if the observed differences are statistically significant.

#### The intended final products

We will first present the trend of injury intent from 1999 to 2016 over all ages and races. Then, we will focus on suicide mortality. The final product of this project would be presented as a website containing discription of our motivation, data source, statistical methods, and conclusion. Barplot plots would be shown to demonstrate suicide potential trend according to sex, age, race, and injury mechanism across years.

#### The anticipated data sources

<https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Injury-Mortality-United-States/nt65-c7a7>

#### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

We aim to analyze the suicide rate changes from 1999-2016 across different ages/races, create graphs to display the trends visually, and conduct formal statistical analysis to decide whether or not the results are significant.
